\# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis



This project focuses on customer segmentation for an e-commerce dataset using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering techniques.



\## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses understand customer value and improve marketing strategies.



\## Dataset

\- Online Retail Dataset (Kaggle)



\## Techniques and Tools Used

\- Data cleaning and preprocessing

\- RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

\- Clustering techniques:

&nbsp; - K-Means clustering

&nbsp; - DBSCAN

&nbsp; - Hierarchical clustering

\- PCA was explored for dimensionality understanding

\- Decision Tree was experimented for interpretability

\- Visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau

\- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
